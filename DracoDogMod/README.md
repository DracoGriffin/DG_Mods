Collection of Mods for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead

To install, place DracoDogMods folder in your /data/mods/ folder.

### Breeding:
Need a pet carrier (acts as a tool), two crated dogs (must be same breed), and
dog food. One will become the mother, other will be returned (father). Gestation
takes 7 days (eventually based on season length). Activate pregnant dog, activate
following items and you should have three (soon to be randomized) dogs spawn near
your character (soon will be puppies that need to be fed) and a resting mother dog
item that will take 2 days to recover (eventually based on season length).
You must remove armor before dogs can be bred.

### Armoring:
Basic system (will be expanded to have leather, bone, chitin, kevlar and superalloy
options).
You can add or remove armor through crafting menu with Kevlar vest or Kevlar dog
harness (cannot craft yet) and one crated dog. You will have to activate dog
after crafting completed.
Essentially improves health (significantly), adds armor to bash/cut, lowers dodge
(by 1) and speed (mainly by weight, heavier dogs aren't as affected whereas
smaller dogs are affected more heavily).

### Training:
Basic system (will eventually be expanded: either specific training that leads to
"certified" attack dog [train dodge, train special attacks, train melee, etc that
requires sufficient player skill and survival] or incremental stages [partially
trained dog -> semi-trained dog -> nearly-trained dog -> attack dog]).
You need suitable skill (attempting under skill requirements can result in loss
of all items -- including dogs -- there isn't a more complex fail system yet in
CDDA to prevent losing certain items), dog whistle, dog food and crated dog.
Training will take significant time (4 hours, subject to change).
Essentially improves aggression (by 1), damage, dodge (by 1), health (slightly),
morale, speed. May add "LUNGE" attack and/or remove "HIT_AND_RUN" depending on
breed.

### Morale:
Eventually add options to interact with dogs for morale bonuses -- certain breeds
may offer larger bonuses (particularly those with GUILT flag, like Beagle,
Chihuahua, Dachshund) -- to also mimic them more as personal dogs rather than
attack animals.
